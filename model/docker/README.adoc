= Locally set up a MySQL database for MicroFlow

. First, install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]

. Then, build a MySQL image from the existing `link:Dockerfile[]` with the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t mysql .
----

. Finally, run a new container based on the built MySQL image with the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name microflow-mysql mysql
----

The newly created container should appear running in the Docker Desktop app. Use the app to manage containers.

This local MySQL environment will be accessible by the `root` user using the `root` password at `localhost:3306`.
