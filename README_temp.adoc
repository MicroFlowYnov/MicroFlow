= MicroFlow

CI/CD industrialization as a microservice architecture for the MicroFlow project.

*_What has been done yet?_*

== MicroFlow project

* Using GitHub
* GitHub organization

=== Frontend

* Using Angular web app
* Features:
** _Observe_ counter value
** Increase counter
** Decrease counter

== Collaboration

* Discord server (channels, permissions, help forum, etc)
* Channel to see GitHub Actions notifications

== GitHub Actions pipeline

* Code reviews are managed and triggered when creating pull requests from `develop` to `main`
* YML file on `main` pull request to (cannot merge if not passing):
. Ensure that the pull request is made from `develop`
. Assert tests
* YML file on `main` push to:

 (code cannot be pushed directly into the branch + tests are asserted when creating a pull request from `develop`)

. Build the app
. Build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub
. Deploy the app on a staging environment
. Draft a new release (to be manually completed and validated)
* Using repository variables and secrets
** SSH connection key:
*** Created a new user on staging server
*** Configured user rights (only allowed to deploy in the `/var/www/html/MicroFlow` directory) and connection using SSH (generated RSA keypair)
*** Referenced the generated private key in repository secrets
* Sending notifications to the Discord server when:
** Build fails
** Deployment fails
** Deployment succeed with creation of a new draft release (to manually review and publish)

== Docker

* Dockerfile to create an image supporting the deployment of the built application on a local Nginx server
* Docker image built and push to Docker Hub by the deploy-release pipeline (YML file)

== Quality and good practices

* Implemented and running tests on frontend and backend using Cypress:
** Is the application available?
** Can the counter be increased to 10^15 or bellow?
** Can the counter be decreased to 0 or above?
* YML file on `main` pull request to:
** Check that only `develop` can be merged into `main`
** Assert tests before allowing to merge (Discord notification on failure)
* YML file on `develop` push to:
** Assert tests (Discord notification on failure)
* ESLint + Husky:
** Linting code before each commit (in the console)
** ESLint setup only to prevent code errors, but could be configurer to handle specific "rules"
** Cancel commit if errors found within the code
** Ensuring a minimale code quality (no error in the code)

== Branch and release management

* Using a mix between GitHub Flow and GitFlow:
** `main` = main branch equivalent to `master`, only full, clean and functional code for releases
** `develop` only clean and functional code, only branch that can be merged with `main` (defined within a YML workflow file)
** Other branches, can be named `feature/...`, `hotfix/...` for better understanding
* Using repository rules to protect `main`: require code reviews on pull requests
* Defined organization teams:
** 'Developers' = able to push and review code
